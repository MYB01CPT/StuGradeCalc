Repository for Summative 115362 Attempt 1. The purpose of this project is to assess my capabilities of managing software development source files using appropriate tools. This is to assess that the retrieval and updating of the source file is in accordance with organization procedures.
After the first commit was pushed through to the master branch as "Initial Commit", an update was made to the retrieved source file as a "Second Commit". In the second commmit, there is now a button in the top right corner of the window. Upon clicking this button, the user will be prompted to enter a value. This value will then be returned to the user.
